# নমুনা লেখা (Bangla Lorem Ipsum Generator)

A web application for generating gibberish text in Bangla (Bengali)

## Inspiration

The original inspiration was a necessity. I was developing many Bengali websites and web portals, and I was in lack of Bengali placeholder text generator. I shared the text "অর্থহীন লেখা" for the first time in one of my blogs, and many of the community used it for filling their white spaces

Later the blog was retired and eventually, I found many other solutions emerging for the same need, but they all somehow lack the ultimate generator

I decided to make the solution as a standalone web app. At that time I came in touch with [BanglaLorem](https://github.com/BanglaLorem/BanglaLorem.github.io) made by Saiful Islam Russel (_aka_ RusselVyper). I loved the idea also. So I decided to adopt the idea as well to make the tool more useful. Instead, I choose a poem named "তরুণ কিশোর" (_Tarun Kishore_) by Jasimuddin (_জসীম উদ্‌দীন_) (1903-1976) the pastoral poet of Bangladesh. Though I changed the line breaks in a way that the generated text can make a little bit of sense

## Credits

The poem _Tarun Kishore_ by Jasimuddin is the heart of the Generator. Also thanks to [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) for the Favicon
